# Project structure

One needs to install the necessary libraries. It is possible to do by using the next commands:

$ pip install "tensorflow>=2.0.0"

$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub

Other libraries (mentioned in the .ipynb notebooks) can be installed if necessary.

1. We introduce the reader to the TensorFlow Hub. TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning or/and deploying. We do that by showing the example of image segmentation.
2.
