# Project structure
1. We introduce the reader to the TensorFlow Hub. TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning or/and deploying. We do that by showing the example of image segmentation.
Full .ipynb file is available under the next link:
.py file which contains the model described in the tutorial above can be accessed via:

2. We take the pretrained model for the classification and try to make transfer learning on it (also we introduce the notion of transfer learning). Full .ipynb file is available under the next link:
